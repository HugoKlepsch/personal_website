title: 'Prevent Sleep'
---

There are definitely better ways to prevent your computer from sleeping, like 
changing the appropriate OS setting, but sometimes you don't have control of
your device, like in a corporate setting. 

My [**prevent-sleep**](https://prevent-sleep.hugo-klepsch.tech/) page uses the 
Screen Wake Lock API to prevent your device from sleeping.

Inspired by other projects like [this one](https://nosleep.page/), but that one 
kept going down so often that I decided to make my own version.
