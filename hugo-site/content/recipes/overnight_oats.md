* 120g dry oats. Steel cut will remain firm. Thinner cuts like minute oats
get mushy
* 35g maple syrup OR 25g sugar
* 30g cocoa powder
* 250g soy milk or milk

1. Combine ingredients. 
	1. The cocoa powder doesn't want to wet. I find it easier to mix the 
    cocoa powder with the oats first, then add wet ingredients.
2. Leave overnight, up to a few days.
