1. Cook beef in a pan, medium-high/high. Looking for some browning. 
Break it up. ~5 minutes.
2. Drain the fat if your lunch-lady was mean. Don't drain it if she was awesome.
3. Stir in onion and garlic powder. Continue to cook ~5 minutes.
4. Stir in tomato paste, ketchup, water, apple cider vinegar, mustard powder,
pepper & brown sugar. Mix well. 
5. Simmer on medium low for 25 to 30 minutes. 
6. Once cooked down to a thick sauce, ready to be served on a hamburger bun.
