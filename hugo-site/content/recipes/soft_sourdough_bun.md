A soft bun, akin to a roll, using sourdough starter as a levener.

See my [sourdough starter](/blog/recipes/sourdough_starter/) recipe for
instructions on how to make and maintain a sourdough starter.

Roughly 65% hydration dough. Works well with inclusions like rosemary, garlic
or cranberries.

* 326g milk, warm
* 43g butter, melted
* 1 egg
* **Active** sourdough starter. 100g in winter, 75g in summer.
* 512g flour
* 20g sugar
* 7g salt

1. Mix milk, butter, egg, sugar. Combine until homogenous. The milk should be 
warm so that the butter does not re-solidify. Don't make too hot, or else 
yeast in starter will die.
2. Add starter to mix. Whisk until dissolved/dispersed.
3. In a second bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add to wet ingredients.
4. Stir until roughly together. Kneed until smooth, no clumps.
5. Cover and let rise for 6 hours.
6. Lightly flower counter and dough exposed in bowl. Using a bench scraper or 
dough scraper, dump onto counter.
7. Separate into parts as large as you want your buns to be ~10-24.
8. Shape into taut buns. 
   1. Gently hold the top of the bun with your hand while pushing/scraping
   the bun with the bench scraper. The goal is to make the dough on the 
   outside tight by pulling it around the "front" of the bun, opposite the side
   pushed by the scraper. *Some* traction between the bun and the counter is 
   required for this maneuver. You are balancing:
      * Hand pressure down into the counter
      * Scraper angle. More 'flat', parallel to the counter, will lift the dough 
      up more, sticking less, whereas a steeper angle helps it stick more. 
      45° is a good start.
      * Amount of loose flour on counter and bun. Less flower, more traction.
9. Rise for 2 hours.
10. Bake in 350°F pre-heated oven for ~25 minutes, or until golden brown, or
190°F internal temperature as desired.
